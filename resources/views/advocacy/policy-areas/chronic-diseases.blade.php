	    		ERS works with policy makers and organisations, such as the European Chronic Disease Alliance, to improve early recognition and early diagnosis of chronic diseases through cost-effective screening methods as well as promote innovative approaches to chronic care such as ehealth and mhealth. The Society also advocates for EU funding for long-term and industry-independent trials in patients with chronic disease.
