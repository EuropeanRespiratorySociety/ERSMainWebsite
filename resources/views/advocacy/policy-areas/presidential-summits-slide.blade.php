		    	The Presidential Summit seeks to present and discuss trends in respiratory health and medicine at the interface of science and policy making. Usually the Presidential Summit seeks to involve a broader range of external stakeholders, such as policymakers, regulatory authorities, public health experts, politicians and industry. The topics are outside the ordinary realms of science and education with the aim of providing diverse perspectives and stimulating discussion and recommendations on possible actions to improve issues that affect respiratory health and care.
