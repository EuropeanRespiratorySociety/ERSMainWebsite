			<h4><strong>ERS President</strong></h4>
			<div class="col-md-8 center-block lead text-left">The ERS President is the head of the Society and takes the leading role in developing and supporting the Society, its committees and members, according to the mission and aims of ERS. <br><br>

			When candidates are elected to this role, they begin a 4-year term within the Presidential Cycle, which consists of the following roles:<br><br>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
	        		<li>Vice-President</li>
	        		<li>President-Elect</li>
	        		<li>President</li>
	        		<li>Past-President</li>
	        	</ul>
	        Each role is held for a year before commencing the next post and accordingly there are always four members of the cycle in post.<br><br>

			Each year, members are able to vote on a new candidate to join the Presidential Cycle as the Past-President completes his or her 4-year term. Candidates are first proposed by the ERS Nominations Committee and approved by the ERS Executive Committee before voting for the new Vice-President is opened to all members. <a href="/about-us/who-we-are.html">For more information on this process, read the Societyâ€™s by-laws.</a><br><br>
